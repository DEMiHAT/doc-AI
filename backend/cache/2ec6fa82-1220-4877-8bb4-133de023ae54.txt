Frontend Development
Considerations Report for
Invoice NLP System
1. Introduction
This report outlines the key technical, UX, architectural, and security-related
considerations required for developing the ReactJS frontend of the Invoice
Extraction & NLP Module.
The goal is to ensure a scalable, user-friendly, and enterprise-ready interface that
integrates smoothly with the FastAPI backend and Cloud OCR pipeline.
2. UX and User Interaction Principles
2.1 Clean and Minimal UI
Since invoices are business documents, the interface must remain:
• simple
professional
• clutter-free
• easy to navigate
2.2 Clear Progress & Status Indicators
The UI must communicate system actions such as:
.
Uploading file
•
Sending to backend
• OCR & NLP processing
Extracting fields

Handling errors
Progress bars, spinners, and status badges improve the user experience.
2.3 Non-blocking User Interface
Ensure users can navigate or cancel actions without freezing the entire page.
2.4 Strong Feedback System
Provide instant feedback for:
Invalid files
Missing fields
• Low confidence values
.
Recognition issues
3. Technical Architecture Considerations
3.1 Separate API Layer
All API calls should be contained inside a dedicated /api folder to ensure:
clean code structure
• reusable endpoints
• centralized error handling
Example: src/api/invoice.js
3.2 Environment Variables
API URLs should be externalized through .env files to support:
development
staging
production
Example:

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
3.3 Component Reusability
Break UI into reusable components such as:
•
File upload
PDF/Image preview
• Editable field elements
• Line item tables
• Confidence indicators
This ensures maintainability and scalability.
3.4 State Management Best Practices
Use:
useState
useEffect
Or lightweight state managers like Zustand/Recoil when needed.
Avoid excessive global state.
3.5 Error Boundaries
React must gracefully handle:
• network failures
• API errors
• invalid data from backend
• slow internet
4. File Upload Considerations

4.1 Local Validation
Before uploading:
Validate file type (PDF/JPG/PNG)
• Validate file size
Safely handle corrupted files
•
Compress large images (optional)
4.2 Preview Before Processing
Offer:
• Inline PDF preview
•
Image preview
• Zoom controls
5. Review and Data Correction Interface
5.1 Editable Fields
Users must be able to:
modify invoice header information
• correct totals
• fix extracted errors
5.2 Editable Line Item Table
The interface must support:
editing rows
adding new rows
deleting rows
recalculating totals

5.3 Confidence-Level Visualization
Color coding:
• Green → High confidence
• Yellow → Medium confidence
Red Low confidence
5.4 Real-time Validation
Frontend should verify:
• GST format
• Numeric correctness
●
Totals Sum(line items)
This reduces errors before submitting to backend.
6. Ul & Styling Standards
6.1 Layout & Spacing
• Max-width containers
8px spacing rules
• Consistent design system
6.2 Component Library
Use:
•
Material UI (recommended)
• TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
6.3 Dark Mode (Optional)
Highly appreciated in ERP environments.

7. Performance Considerations
7.1 Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders
Use:
React.memo
Split components
• Avoid large nested states
7.2 Lazy Load Heavy Components
Like:
• PDF renderers
●
Charts or tables
7.3 Debounce Input Events
Prevents performance drops during fast editing.
8. Security Considerations
8.1 No API Keys on Frontend
OCR and NLP keys must remain on the backend.
8.2 Proper CORS Configuration
Frontend and backend must allow communication without exposing vulnerabilities.
8.3 Sanitization
Never trust backend data blindly; validate before rendering.
9. Testing & Validation
9.1 Test with Multiple Invoice Types

• Scanned
•
Digital
• Rotated
• Multi-page
Low-quality images
9.2 Simulate Slow Networks
Frontend must handle network latency gracefully.
9.3 Test for Large Files
Invoices may exceed 5-10 MB.
10. Deployment Considerations
10.1 Environment Switching
Ensure easy switching between:
• local
•
staging
•
prod
10.2 Build Optimization
Use:
npm run build
for production-ready assets.
10.3 CDN/ERP Integration
Frontend may be embedded inside ERP modules.

11. Collaboration & Development Practices
11.1 Separate Frontend & Backend Projects
Each runs independently; easier maintenance.
11.2 API Contract Documentation
Shared agreement for:
request format
• response structure
error types
11.3 Proper Git Workflow
•
Feature branches
• Pull requests
• Code reviews
12. Conclusion
A well-architected React frontend is essential for delivering a seamless and
reliable user experience in the invoice extraction workflow.
By following the principles outlined above-focusing on UI clarity, error-proofing,
security, reusability, and maintainability-the system will be scalable, user-
friendly, and production-grade.
