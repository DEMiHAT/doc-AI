Project Report: Plug
NLP Module for Invoice
Extraction
-and-Play
1. Overview
This report outlines the architecture, research-backed design principles, best
practices, and technology stack for developing a plug-and-play NLP module for
invoice extraction. The system is designed to be integrated across multiple
enterprise projects, with full support for OCR, NLP, LLM-enhanced reasoning, and
a scalable API backend.
2. Objectives
• Automate invoice field extraction from scanned PDFs and images
•
Eliminate manual data entry and reduce errors
• Create a reusable, microservice-style module that integrates with any ERP or
financial system
•
Support line-item extraction and layout-aware understanding
3. Key Benefits
Up to 80% reduction in manual AP effort
• 2-5x faster invoice processing time
• Consistent data quality for audits and analytics
Plug-and-play integration with any existing system via API
•
4. Best Practices (From Industry Research)
• Modular Pipeline: Image Preprocessing → OCR → NLP/NER → Validation →
Output
Project Report: Plug-and-Play NLP Module for Invoice Extraction
Layout-Aware Models: Use models like LayoutLM or Donut for spatial
understanding
Hybrid Logic: Combine ML with rule-based checks for numeric integrity
Confidence Scores + Human Review: Use thresholds to trigger manual
validation
Containerization: Deploy with Docker/Kubernetes for reuse across teams
• Standard JSON Output: Maintain consistent schema for easy ERP mapping
5. Business Challenges Solved
•
Manual data entry errors
• Format inconsistency across vendors
•
High processing time for bulk invoices
• Lack of scalable automation
•
Regulatory risk from data loss/misentry
6. Technical Challenges Identified
• OCR noise and document quality issues
Vendor-specific invoice layouts
• Line item table parsing complexity
• Model drift over time
Integration with legacy ERP systems
7. Technology Stack
Backend
•
FastAPI: High-performance, async REST API server
• Uvicorn: ASGI server for FastAPI
•
Pydantic & Pydantic Settings: Data validation and environment config

OCR & NLP
google-cloud-documentai: Industry-grade OCR
• Tesseract (fallback, optional)
• sentence-transformers: Semantic understanding
LangChain + VertexAl + ChromaDB: LLM-backed extraction + vector search
Machine Learning
• scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib: Traditional ML + preprocessing
Database
SQLAlchemy, Alembic: ORM and migrations
Frontend/UI
• Streamlit: Internal dashboard for review & validation
• Pillow: Image processing
Dev & Test
• pytest, httpx, pytest-asyncio: Async and integration testing
8. Development Roadmap (30 Days)
