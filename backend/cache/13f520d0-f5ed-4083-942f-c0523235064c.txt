Comparative Report: Cloud
OCR vs Local OCR (Tesseract
for Invoice NLP System
)
1. Introduction
This report analyzes the operational, technical, and financial impact of choosing
Cloud OCR (e.g., Google Document Al, Amazon Textract) versus Local OCR
(Tesseract) for the invoice extraction module of our NLP-driven ERP plugin.
The goal is to determine which OCR strategy provides the best balance of cost,
accuracy, scalability, data security, and maintenance overhead, based on
expected usage volume and system architecture.

3. Cloud OCR (
Analysis
Document Al / Textract) –
3.1. Pricing
Cloud OCR pricing follows a usage-based model:
●
Typical: $1.50 per 1,000 pages for basic text extraction
Table/Forms extraction cost is higher
High-volume discounts available
Cloud OCR is cheaper at low/moderate volume but scales linearly with usage.
3.2. Advantages
1. High Accuracy
Cloud OCR models are trained on millions of documents:
•
Excellent table detection
• Perfect for multi-format invoices
• Handles skewed, noisy, or low-quality scans
2. Almost No Maintenance
All optimizations, model updates, and scaling are handled by the provider.
3. Faster Time-to-Market
No need to build preprocessing, deskewing, or table-recognition models.
4. Guaranteed Scalability
Can handle 100 requests or 1 million requests without infrastructure changes.
3.3. Disadvantages
Recurring cost increases with volume

2
At scale (e.g., 100k invoices/month), monthly costs can grow significantly.
Data privacy concerns
Invoices must be sent to an external cloud.
Network latency
Each file upload + processing + response adds ~200-600 ms.
4. Local OCR (Tesseract)-Analysis
4.1. Pricing
Tesseract is free, but requires compute resources:
• A single 2-4 CPU server: 3,000-10,000/month
Can process thousands of pages/month
Effectively zero per-page fee
Ideal for long-term cost savings at scale.
4.2. Advantages
1. Zero Per-Page Cost
Costs do not increase with usage.
2. Complete Data Control
No upload to external services → safer for:
•
invoices, supplier data
• finance records
• PII data
3. Fast local processing
No network overhead, low latency.

4.3. Disadvantages
Lower Accuracy
Especially poor at:
• tables
multi-line text
low-quality scans
●
variable invoice formats
No native table extraction
Requires heavy custom logic:
• column detection
bounding-box grouping
ML-assisted table parsing
row segmentation
High Engineering Effort
Setting up:
preprocessing
•
resizing
• thresholding
• skew correction
noise reduction
requires expertise.
Scaling requires more servers
More invoices: = more CPU/RAM → higher server bills.

5. Cost Example (INR)
Volume
Cloud OCR (DocAl/Textract) Local OCR (Server Cost)
1,000 invoices/month
~125
~3,000 (same server)
10,000 invoices/month
~1,250
~3,000
100,000 invoices/month
~12,500
~10,000 (extra servers)
1,000,000 invoices/month 125,000+
~20,000-30,000
Observation
Cloud OCR is cheaper at low volume,
Local OCR is cheaper at high volume.
6. Recommendation for Our Project
Phase 1 (MVP / Pilot): Cloud OCR
Why?
Highest accuracy → best user experience
• Zero maintenance
• Faster development
• Works across all invoice types
Phase 2 (Scaling): Hybrid OCR Model
Use:
• Cloud OCR for complex invoices
• Tesseract for clean/simple invoices
Configurable by client reduces cost
Phase 3 (Large-Scale Deployment): Local OCR Engine
If invoice volume becomes very high (50k-500k/month), build a robust:

layout analysis model
This shifts the system to a low-cost, high-volume solution.
7. Conclusion
Cloud OCR → High accuracy, high convenience, scalable,
recurring cost
Local OCR → Low cost, highly customizable, more
maintenance, lower accuracy
For the current ERP plugin project where accuracy and rapid development matter
most:
Start with Cloud OCR (Google Document Al)
Add Tesseract as a fallback or cost-optimization option
Design OCR as a pluggable module so client can switch engines
This provides the best balance of accuracy, cost-control, speed, and flexibility.
